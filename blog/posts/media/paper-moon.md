## 歌词


```text
It's Only A Paper Moon - Paul McCartney


Say' its only a paper moon
不过是纸月亮

Sailing over a cardboard sea
航行在纸做的海洋中

But it wouldn't be make-believe
但那不会是假的

If you believed in me
但愿你相信我

Yes' it's only a canvas sky
天空只是帆布制的

Hanging over a muslin tree
悬挂在棉布制的树上

But it wouldn't be make-believe
但那不会是假的

If you believed in me
但愿你相信我

Without your love
没有你的爱

It's a honky-tonk parade
那将会是一首飘荡的酒吧音乐

Without your love
没有你的爱

It's a melody played in a penny arcade
那将会是播放在游乐场的旋律

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
那是Barnum与Bailey的世界

Just as phony as it can be
就像是虚假的一样

But it wouldn't be make-believe
但那不会是假的

If you believed in me
但愿你相信我

Without your love
没有你的爱

It's a honky-tonk parade
那将会是一首飘荡的酒吧音乐

Without your love
没有你的爱

It's a melody played in a penny arcade
那将会是播放在游乐场的旋律

It's a Barnum and Bailey world
那是Barnum与Bailey的世界

Just as phony as it can be
就像是虚假的一样

But it wouldn't be make-believe
但那不会是假的

If you believed in me
但愿你相信我

If you believed in me
但愿你相信我

If you believed in me
但愿你相信我
```
